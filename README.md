## Project Brief

This project involves analyzing the results of a digital experiment conducted by Vanguard Investment Management Group to determine if a new User Interface (UI) design improves client process completion rates.The goal is to determine if a new UI design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

## The Experiment Conducted

An A/B test was conducted from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 with the following groups:
- **Control Group**: Clients interacted with the traditional online process.
- **Test Group**: Clients experienced the new UI design.

Both groups followed the same process sequence, including an initial page, three steps, and a confirmation page.

## Importing and Exploring Data

pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib.pyplot scipy.stats

## Installation

## Data Sources
We will use three datasets for this analysis:
- Client Profiles ("data/df_final_demo.txt"): Contains demographics such as age, gender, and account details of Vanguard clients.
- Digital Footprints ("data/df_final_web_data_pt_1.txt"), ("data/df_final_web_data_pt_2.txt"): Detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2. These need to be merged for comprehensive analysis.
- Experiment Roster ("data/df_final_experiment_clients.txt"): Identifies which clients participated in the experiment and their group allocation (Control or Test).

## Data Preparation & Merging Datasets
- Merge Digital Footprints: Combine pt_1 and pt_2 from the df_final_web_data dataset to form a complete view of client interactions.
- Join Datasets: Integrate the merged digital footprints with the client profiles (df_final_demo) and the experiment roster (df_final_experiment_clients).
- Univariate Analysis and Visualisation: Understand the demographics and perform statistical analysis on each variable.

## Data Cleaning
1) Dropping Null Values: Identify and appropriately drop any missing values in the datasets.
3) Outlier Detection: Detect and handle outliers that could skew the analysis.

### 1. Completion Rate Hypothesis

**H0**: The completion rate of the new design (Test group) is equal to or lower than the old design (Control group).

**H1**: The completion rate of the new design (Test group) is higher than the old design (Control group).

**Results**:
- Control group completion rate: 49.84%
- Test group completion rate: 58.52%
- The Z-Statistic is -22.89, and the p-value is extremely small (5.39e-116), which is much less than the alpha level of 0.05.

**Interpretation**:
- Since the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1).
- Conclusion: The completion rate of the new design (Test group) is statistically significantly higher than that of the old design (Control group).

### 2. Cost-Effectiveness Hypothesis

**H0**: The new design does not lead to a minimum increase of 5% in the completion rate.

**H1**: The new design leads to a minimum increase of 5% in the completion rate.

**Results**:
- Control group completion rate: 49.84%
- Test group completion rate: 58.52%
- Z-Statistic: 22.89
- P-Value : 0.0000

![Cost Effectiveness](https://github.com/Josepdmo/PROJECT2/blob/main/Images/Cost%20Effective%205%25%20Threshold.png)

**Interpretation**:
- The increase in completion rate is approximately 8.68% ((58.52 - 49.84) / 49.84 * 100), which exceeds the 5% threshold. 
- Based on the results of the z-test, we reject the null hypothesis, providing strong evidence that the new design leads to a completion rate increase confirming the new design's cost-effectiveness.

### 3. Engagement Hypothesis

**H0**: The session durations of clients using the new UI are equal to or shorter than those using the old UI.

**H1**: The session durations of clients using the new UI are longer than those using the old UI.

**Results** (average session duration in seconds):
| Step    | Control Avg Duration (s) | Test Avg Duration (s) | t-statistic | p-value      |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Start   | 54.335477                | 61.809148             | -4.25       | 2.060898e-05 |
| Step 1  | 42.568871                | 37.394860             | 6.74        | 1.496968e-11 |
| Step 2  | 38.524249                | 47.820970             | -13.24      | 5.650431e-40 |
| Step 3  | 92.515996                | 95.863682             | -3.073      | 2.117474e-03 |
| Confirm | 122.694765               | 111.959636            | 5.29        | 1.225098e-07 |


![Average Time Spent](https://github.com/Josepdmo/PROJECT2/blob/main/Images/Average%20Time%20-%20Engagement.png)

**Interpretation**:
- The new UI significantly increased session durations at the "Start" and "Step 2" stages,indicating reduced efficiency at these points.
- For "Step 1" and "Confirm", the new UI resulted in significantly shorter durations, suggesting improved efficiency in these stages.
- While the new UI shows potential benefits in "Step 1" and "Confirm", it also introduces inefficiencies in "Start" and "Step 2".
- Further refinement is needed to address the observed issues and enhance overall user experience.

### 4. Task Efficiency Hypothesis

**H0**: Clients in the test group complete the process with the same or higher error rates and retries compared to the control group.

**H1**: Clients in the test group complete the process with fewer errors and retries compared to the control group.

**Results**:
- Control group error rate: 6.77%
- Test group error rate: 9.19%
- Chi-Square Test: Chi2 = 625.11, p-value < 0.05

![Error Rates](https://github.com/Josepdmo/PROJECT2/blob/main/Images/Error%20Rates%20-Task%20Efficiency.png)

**Interpretation**:
The higher error rate in the Test group suggests the new UI leads to more user errors. The Chi-Square test shows a very small p-value, indicating the difference in error rates is statistically significant. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, confirming the Test group has higher error rates, suggesting that the new UI is less efficient.

## Conclusion

Significant Increase in Completion Rate: The new design has been demonstrated to significantly increase the completion rate by approximately 8.68%, which is a meaningful improvement compared to the old design. This suggests that the new design is generally more effective in facilitating user tasks and achieving goals.

Mixed Impact on Efficiency: The new UI improves efficiency in certain stages ("Step 1" and "Confirm") but introduces inefficiencies at the "Start" and "Step 2" stages. This mixed impact highlights that while the new design has strengths, there are also areas requiring attention.

Higher Error Rates Indicate Reduced Efficiency: The higher error rate associated with the new UI suggests that while there are benefits in completion rates and certain efficiency improvements, the overall user experience is compromised due to increased errors. This indicates that the new UI might not be fully optimized.

Need for Further Refinement: The results underscore the need for further refinement of the new UI to address the inefficiencies and error-prone stages identified. A balanced approach is required to retain the benefits while mitigating the drawbacks.

Cost-Effectiveness Requires Caution: Although the new design demonstrates an increase in completion rates, the associated increase in error rates must be considered when evaluating cost-effectiveness. The designâ€™s overall impact on user experience and error reduction should be a key focus in future enhancements.

## Recommendations

The decision on which website is better depends on the specific priorities of Vanguard Investment Management Group:

1. Refine the New UI Design: Since the new UI leads to higher error rates and reduced efficiency at certain stages (particularly "Start" and "Step 2"), it is recommended to focus on redesigning these specific stages. Conduct further usability testing and gather qualitative feedback to understand the root causes of the inefficiencies and user errors. Iteratively improve the UI to address these issues.

2. Optimize the Stages with Increased Efficiency: The new UI has shown improvements in "Step 1" and "Confirm." Leverage these successful aspects by incorporating similar design principles into the stages with identified inefficiencies. This approach can help balance the overall user experience and capitalize on the design improvements.

3. Conduct Additional Testing: Implement A/B testing or other forms of user experience research to assess whether the refined UI addresses the identified inefficiencies without negatively impacting the areas where the new design has been effective. This will help ensure that changes lead to overall improvements without unintended consequences.

4. Monitor Long-Term Performance: Track the performance of the new UI over a longer period to assess if the initial improvements and issues persist. Collect feedback from a broader user base to ensure that the refinements address a wide range of user needs and scenarios.

5. User Training and Support: Given the increase in error rates, providing users with additional training or support materials may help mitigate the impact of these errors. This can include tutorials, tooltips, or help guides specifically targeted at the stages where users struggle the most.
